# Trader AI: Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading

## Project goal
This project focuses on formulating a stock trading strategy by applying reinforcement learning that allows an autonomous agent to make decisions by interacting with its environment and optimising cumulative reward signals. Unlike traditional trading strategies, which frequently depend on predefined rules or historical time series data analysis and may struggle to adapt to fluctuating market dynamics, reinforcement learning provides a versatile framework capable of real-time adaptation and learning.
