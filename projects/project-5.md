# Satellite Image Analysis and Object Detection

This project is a vehicle detection system for satellite images, which aims to be utilized in situations such as urban planning and traffic management. The system is implemented with two models – Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5, as well as the Roboflow dataset. 
The Faster R-CNN model is known for its precision in detecting objects. It applies a region proposal network used to draw the object bounding box and provide scores on how likely a detected instance is an object. The YOLOv5 model’s strengths show in speed and efficiency, which is useful for processing the image in real-time.
