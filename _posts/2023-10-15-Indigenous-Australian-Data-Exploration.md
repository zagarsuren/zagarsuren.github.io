# Indigenous Australian Data: Tableau Data Visualisation

The data preparation process includes finding data from credible sources, preparing data, visualising data on Tableau and exporting the results. An illustration of the process is shown in the figure below.

#### Snapshots of the Indigenous statistics

## 1. Indigenous Population

The Australian Indigenous population comprised 3.4% of the total Australian population in the 2021 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In 2021, 812,728 people were counted as Indigenous, 91.4% as Aboriginal, 4.2% as Torres Strait Islanders, and 4.4% as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (ABS, 2021).

Approximately 34.2% of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population resided in New South Wales in 2021. Another 29.2% lived in Queensland, and 10.9% lived in Western Australia. The people who lived in Victoria, Northern Territory, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory made up 8.1%, 7.5%, 3.7% and 1.1% of total Indigenous Population.

As of 2021, the age distribution within the First Nations community skews towards youth, with a higher percentage of individuals aged 29 and below, in contrast to the non-Indigenous population. Specifically, approximately one-third (33%) of the First Nations population fell under 15, while this figure stood at 18% for non-Indigenous individuals within the same age group.

## 2. Indigenous Language and Culture

The decline in the proportion of First Nations people in Australia who spoke a First Nations language at home, as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), is a significant trend. The data shows an apparent decrease in the use of First Nations languages in the home environment over the years. In 1991, 16.4% of First Nations people spoke a First Nations language at home. By 2006, this proportion had decreased to 11.4%. In 2021, it decreased even further to 9.5%. This decline in the use of First Nations languages at home may be due to various factors, including the impact of English language dominance, urbanisation, and generational shifts.

The 2018-19 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey data highlights the strong connections that First Nations people in Australia have to their family, community, and culture (AIHW, 2023). 
Recognition of Homeland/Traditional Country:
* 74% of First Nations people aged 18 and over recognised an area as their homeland or traditional country. This recognition was more prevalent in remote areas, where 90% of individuals identified with a homeland or traditional country, compared to 71% in non-remote areas.
Identification with Tribal Group, Language, Clan, Mission, or Regional Group:
* 65% of First Nations people identified with a tribal group, language, clan, mission, or regional group. Similar to the recognition of homeland or traditional country, this identification was higher in remote areas, with 86% of individuals identifying with these groups, compared to 61% in non-remote areas.
Living on Homeland:
* 27% of First Nations people aged 18 and over lived in their homeland. This rate was notably higher in remote areas, where 47% of individuals lived in their homeland, while in non-remote areas, it was 23%.
These statistics reflect the importance of land, community, and cultural connections for First Nations people. 

# 3. Education

The tertiary education attainment gap has not changed in the last 20 years. The line chart below highlights a significant educational gap between First Nations Australians and non-Indigenous Australians in the 25-34 age group. 

First Nations Australians aged 25-34:
* 47% had completed a tertiary qualification. 
Non-Indigenous Australians aged 25-34:
* 76% had completed a tertiary qualification.

This data shows a substantial gap in educational attainment between these two demographic groups. The lower percentage of First Nations Australians with tertiary qualifications may indicate broader socioeconomic and educational disparities that need to be addressed through targeted policies and initiatives to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for First Nations individuals. Closing the educational gap is crucial to achieving broader social and economic equality.

This difference in completion rates between major cities and very remote areas suggests significant challenges and barriers to accessing and completing education in more remote and isolated parts of the country. These challenges may include limited access to educational resources, schools, teachers, and other factors affecting educational opportunities. 

# 4. Employment and Income 

The line chart shows notable differences in the employment rates among First Nations people in different geographic areas in Australia in 2021. 

Major Cities:
* 58% of First Nations people were employed in major cities.
Very Remote Areas:
* Only 30% of First Nations people were employed in very remote areas.

This decline in employment rates with increasing remoteness highlights the economic challenges First Nations people living in more remote and isolated regions face. Several factors can contribute to this trend, including limited job opportunities, economic disparities, and the challenges of accessing education and training in remote areas.

#### Main occupation groups
Over-representation in labour and Community and Personal Service Occupations:
* First Nations people were over-represented in labouring and community and personal service occupations. This suggests that more First Nations people were employed in manual and service-oriented roles than non-Indigenous people.

Under-representation in Professional and Managerial Roles:
* First Nations people were under-represented in professional and managerial occupations. A smaller proportion of First Nations individuals held professional and managerial positions than non-Indigenous people. Specifically, the data shows that 14% of working-age non-Indigenous Australians were managers, while only 8% of First Nations people held managerial positions in 2021. This under-representation in managerial roles highlights an area where there is room for improvement in providing opportunities and support for First Nations people to access and advance in these positions (ABS, 2021).

#### First Nations people have a 2-3 times lower income than non-Indigenous Australians.
There is an income gap between First Nations households and non-Indigenous households. Additionally, there are regional variations in income levels among First Nations households, with the Australian Capital Territory having the highest income and the Northern Territory having the lowest.
